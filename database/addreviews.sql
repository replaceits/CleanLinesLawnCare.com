    "Here's what to expect: A very pleasant experience from a local, family owned business. I am a contractor in Charlottesville and I found this company on Facebook, actually (you can check out photos of their work on their Fb page), after an associate/contractor recommended them. I'm very pleased with the driveway addition they did for us. They completed the project as scheduled (and they didn't run home when the rain started, which would have obviously left the homeowners with a mess in the rain) and on the quoted rate with no surprises. I will use Clean Lines again and I highly recommend this local Charlottesville biz!",
